Application for search New York Times movie reviews and get movie critics using [React](https://reactjs.org), [Redux](https://redux.js.org), Hooks, [redux-saga](https://redux-saga.js.org) and [styled-components](https://styled-components.com).

The application allows you search New York Times movie reviews by keyword and filter by Critic's Pick and Reviewer, also supports ordering results by title, by publication date, or by opening date. It's possible to get all New York Times movie critics, and ou can either specify the reviewer name. The movie reviews can be added to a favorites list that is stored in the application state.

The Movie Reviews API from [The New York Times Developer Network](https://developer.nytimes.com/) was used to get all the data.

The code base is covered by automated tests with [Jest](https://jestjs.io) and [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme).

The project is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). And a CI/CD workflow created on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is responsible for automatically test the source code, generate a coverage report and upload it on [Codecov](https://codecov.io), build and deploy the project on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). All these jobs are activated by a push or pull request event on master branch.
